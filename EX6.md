<div align = "justify">
Implementing Information Retrieval using the Vector Space Model in Python involves several steps, including preprocessing text data, constructing a term-document matrix, 
calculating TF-IDF scores, and performing similarity calculations between queries and documents. Below is a basic example using Python and libraries like nltk and 
sklearn to demonstrate Information Retrieval using the Vector Space Model.

### Procedure:
1. Define sample documents.
2. Preprocess text data by tokenizing, removing stopwords, and punctuation.
3. Construct a TF-IDF matrix using TfidfVectorizer from sklearn.
4. Define a search function that calculates cosine similarity between a query and documents based on the TF-IDF matrix.
5. Execute a sample query and display the search results along with similarity scores.
